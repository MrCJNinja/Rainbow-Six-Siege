        <h1>Operation Hidden Eyes!!! (Y5S2)</h1>
        
        <p>Let start first off by saying this season is gonna be a hell of a season! All of this gets me really excited! The most I'm excited about is the House Rework! It seems that they have made it a bit bigger, but it is still going to be a easy map to study for the new players! The theme is on point! They took away all the orange walls and started on making a multicolor house, for easier callouts. All I know for complete undeniable proof is that the construction room is now another finished kids room, but it's is pink, so no confusion on that part. If I get more information, I will be sure to post it on this page! Thank you!</p>
        
        <h2>Operator Adjustments!</h2>
        
        <strong>Jager:</strong> They're are nerfing Jager <strong>AGAIN!!!</strong> They took his <em>ACOG</em> and now <strong><em>THIS?</em></strong> He is going to go from a 3 speed to a to speed, taking away his peeker's advantage usage. The "fast as f***" boi is now going to be equally as likely played as an anchor as a roamer, from the nerf AND his barbwire/deployable camera. This will also give way to more Wamai play!<br><br>
        
            <strong>Buck:</strong> The first DLC operator that came out, buck, is now being <strong>nerfed!!!</strong> This man and his players always enjoyed his utility with the skeleton key, <strong>AND</strong> on top of <em>that</em> having a frag to flush out any enemies on bomb! Well the <strong><em>DEVS</em></strong> though that was <strong>TOO</strong> much and took his frags away like they the ACOG to Jager. He now has a claymore that, don't get me wrong, is pretty good, but is thrown out the window when compared to frags! Honestly, they did add more ammo to his skeleton key shotgun, but still. <strong>OOF!</strong><br><br>
            
            <strong>Kaid/Goyo:</strong> Y'all probably looking at me like "Aye, dummy, I don't think you can nerf these guys, they aren't overpowered!" <strong>THAT'S ALSO WHAT I THOUGHT!!!</strong> They got  <strong>heavily</strong> nerfed! The TCSG-12, the shotgun (more like DMR) is getting nerfed from 84 DMG down to <em><strong>55 DMG!!!</strong></em> What IS that?!? The devs said that his shotgun is WAY too overpowered!!! If the devs had enough balls to cut back the DMG by almost 30 points, there must have been something wrong. I myself think that the TCSG-12 is a bit broken in the fire rate, ACOG, emmense damage, and range is baffling, especially since they are used by a 2 armor (Goyo) and a 3 armor (Kaid)<br><br>
            
                <strong>Mozzie:</strong> Hey! This is ironic! Mozzie's a shorty and he's getting his super shorty taken away from him altogether! He's now stuck with the SDP 9MM, the pistol both Gridlock and Mozzie has access to. The devs think that Mozzie has too much utility with his gadget <strong>AND</strong> his super shorty for rotation holes. Mozzie is another Ela, you hate them on the other team, but love them on yours. Now, with no super shorty, he may get picked less often. <br><br>
                
            <strong>Lord Tachanka:</strong> I think about everyone who plays R6 knows of this one. Lord Tachanka (what everyone should refer to him as) is getting not one tweek, not two, but a whole rework! One of his primaries are going to be <strong>THE TURRET, BUT OFF HIS STAND!!! HE IS ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO EQUIP A SPECIAL HOLO LIKE SIGHT ON IT!!!</strong> He is going to be walking around <strong>WITH A TURRET!!! DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED WITH A ROAMING LORD TACHANKA!!!!!</strong> His turret is goiing to be replaced with an <strong>incediary grenade launcher that can BOUNCE OFF WALLS!!!</strong> This will definitely make Lord Tachanka live up to his almighty name, also making him way more relevant.<br><br>
            
            <strong>Caviera:</strong> Finally! A buff this season! Hey Cav  fans, have you ever wanted the razor holo on the M12 (Cav's smg)? The one Frost has on her 9mm C1 (Frost's smg)? Well, wish granted! Cav now has the razor holo on her M12. This decision by the devs are the make gameplay with the M12 more frequent then just everyone choosing the SPAS-15 (Cav's shotgun).<br><br>
            
            <strong>Ying:</strong> Another buff?!? Yep! Ying is already good as she is, her LMG is broken, and her Candela's are downright annoying. But Ubisoft decided to buff her. They're are giving Ying one more of her Candelas, and her T-95 LSW is getting a damage boost, with an extra magazine. Good call Ubisoft. Straight <strong>crush</strong> the hearts of Goyo and Kaid players everywhere, but decide to <strong>buff</strong> an <strong>already broken Ying</strong>!            
            <h2>More Concepts!</h2>
            a
                <strong>Ping 2.0:</strong> Have you ever, and I mean ever, saw a gadget like a Welcome Mat (Frost) or a EDD (Kapkan) and wanted to ping <strong>SO BAD?</strong> Well now you can! Ping 2.0! It can absorb... I'm just kidding. Ping 2.0 is something Ubisoft came up with back in Operation Void Edge and is applying it to Operation Hidden Eyes.. Basically the idea is that anyone can just scan for devices, pinging them. Almost like, scracth that, more like a heads up. They will allow you to do it in realtime too, yet I don't think anyone is going to stop in the middle of a fight to ping a Bandit battery.<br><br>
                <strong>Replay:</strong> After a game, you alway have that question, "How did he rotate there?" or "How did he kill me?" or "Where did he go after that?" Well, I have good news for you! The devs are introducing <strong>Game Replay!</strong> After the game, you can replay the game in a pro league format. You can view anyone's perspective (except the hostage and dead people), or you can do a bird's eye view. Essentially, it's a spectating mode for a game you already played. Which means, <strong>YOU CAN PAUSE IT!!!</strong> Honestly, this is gonna be only for one end or another if the spectrum. If you're a pro/serious player, you're gonna wanna review ways to perfect tactics and such. If you're a troll or noob player, you're gonna use it to laugh at your/the opposition's mistakes.<br><br>
                <strong>New secondary gadgets:</strong> Ubisoft thought that the new secondary gadgets that are being implemented are good for the game, and I guess they are too. The new attacker secondary gadget is a breach charge llike thing that breach through reinforced walls. Don't worry it's still inferior to Hibana and Thermite, because it only makes a hole as small as one of Hibana's X-Kairo Pellets (fidget spinners). They don't work on electrified reinforced walls. The new defender secondary gadget is a motion sensitive alarm. Whenever an attacker walks past it, an alarm goes off, notifying the defenders by sound que. It can be easily shot out, and no, NÃ¶kk and fool it.<br><br>
                <strong>Russian Optics:</strong> The devs are pondering on if they should take away the russian optics that are currently shared by the Spetsnaz and Finka. If they do, this may effect a new operator that we are talking about. Keep reading to see.<br><br>
                <strong>Pistol Optics:</strong> Hey, have you ever one the optics on Clash's, Ela's, and Zofia's pistol to be universal? Well, I have news for you! They may grant your wish by providing so! The devs at Ubisoft are thinking about giving all pistols in the game optics. So you may be able to hit grapes with your newly customized secondary.
            
            <h2>Arcade Event!</h2>
            <p>With Operation Hidden Eyes, we're gonna have another arcade event like "Golden Gun." It's gonna be called "<strong>Stolen Goods</strong>." It's gonna be played on the old Hereford Base layout, but with the new Hereford Base theme. Most of the floors are completely destructible, so you can theoretically destroy a whole floor, denying some rooms. It's like domination on drugs. You have to capture these safes scaddered around the map. We don't have the full understanding of how it works yet, but we will eventually, and will update this website.</p>
            Now thing we've all been waiting for...
            <h2>New Operators!</h2>
            <h3>South African Defender: Philisiwe!</h3>
            <h4>Gadget</h4>
            <p>Philisiwe is another "Thicc Boi" along with Doc, Rook, and Maestro. He is a 1 speed, 3 armor operator, and has a <strong>very</strong> special gadget. Her gadget is called "Smart Barbwire." Her barbwire slows attackers and drones more than regular barbwire, and it does damage overtime to attackers. It is immune to melee hit, but does get destroyed by explosives. (That's right, Sledge can't defeat Philisiwe). The barbwire also pings attacker drones that go through it, making it easier to destroy them.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <p>Her weapons consist of the T5-SMG, the smg Lesion has that has little to no recoil, but Philisiwe will have the ability to <em>equip an ACOG onto it</em>. Her other primary is the ITA12L that Jackal and Mira has as their shotgun. This is the primary shotgun, mind you, not the pocket ITA12S. Don't get confused. Her only secondary of choice is the RG-15, a pistol that both Ela and Zofia have. Will Philisiwe have a sight to it too? We don't know. We do know that Philisiwe is going to be a heavy anchor, as a peeker, or just camping in the corner. We think she might be aggresive, because if the ACOG on the T5-SMG</p>
            <h3>Norwegian Attacker: Odin!</h3>
            <h4>Gadget</h4>
            <p>Odin is a stealth attacker. Odin is a 2 speed, to armor, with a really cool gadget. She will have a "Spider Drone" that can climb walls and ceilings! The drone can also release a puff of smoke that heals teammates. It can also act as cover for the drone to escape. We don't know, though, if the drone will have the ability to revive teammates in the DBNO state (Down but not out). If so, we also don't know if Odin can revive himself when he's in the DBNO state.</p>
            <h4>Weapons</h4>
            <p>For Odin's primaries, he will have the choice between arguably two of the best Assault Rifles in R6. The C7E, the assualt that only Jackal has access to! Solid rate of fire with damage out of this world! His other primary will be Ak-12, the assualt rifle only Fuze has access to! Will it have russian sights? Just like we said in the "More Concepts!" category, we don't exactly know. For his secondaries, he will have the choice between the PMM, a very solid Spetsnaz, and the SDP 9MM, belonging to the Burnt Horizon operator, Gridlock and Mozzie. If you remember, Mozzie is stuck to using the SDP 9MM because his super shorty got taken away. Gridlock almost always uses the super shorty she still has.</p> 
            <p class="thx">Thank you for reading until the end! If you ant to learn more about R6, I suggest looking at videos on YouTube from "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/VarsityGaming">VarsityGaming</a>", "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VD-9m72i3Oyl19cm-GgPQ">Rogue-9</a>", and "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/iceycat25">iceycat25</a>". These are YouTubers that post updates from Rainbow Six Siege to the R6 commmunity. I got all of the information on Operation Hidden Eyes from these YouTubers and from the <a href="https://r6siegecenter.com/rainbow-six-siege-y5s2-leak-operation-hidden-eyes/">R6 Siege Center</a> which is run by the R6 branch of Ubisoft itself so it's incredibly accurate. Some other stuff is found on a video by iceycat25 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wG_fcT-OUA8">right here</a>. Thank you!</p>
